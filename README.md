## :hash: <a name="why">Why JavaScript</a>:
&nbsp; :arrow_right: Why should I use JavaScript? :one:  we don‚Äôt have a choice :two: JavaScript is really good. It is lightweight and expressive. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: It is possible to get work done quickly with JavaScript without knowing much about the language, or even knowing much about programming. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: It is a language with enormous expressive power. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: JavaScript is an universal programming language <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: JavaScript is a remarkably powerful language because it has more in common with Lisp and Scheme than with Java. It is Lisp in C‚Äôs clothing. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: JavaScript functions are first class objects with lexical scoping. <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: JavaScript has a very powerful object literal notation. Objects can be created simply by listing their components which was the inspiration for JSON (data interchange format). <br />
&nbsp; :arrow_right: **Functions**, **loose typing**, **dynamic objects**, **expressive object literal notation** are some of the good parts of JS (except a programming model based on global variables). <br />
