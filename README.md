## :hash: <a name="whyjs">Why JavaScript</a>:
:arrow_right: Why should I use JavaScript? :one:  we don‚Äôt have a choice :two: JavaScript is really good. It is lightweight and expressive. <br />
:arrow_right: It is possible to get work done quickly with JavaScript without knowing much about the language, or even knowing much about programming. <br />
:arrow_right: It is a language with enormous expressive power. <br />
:arrow_right: JavaScript is an universal programming language <br />
:arrow_right: JavaScript is a remarkably powerful language because it has more in common with Lisp and Scheme than with Java. It is Lisp in C‚Äôs clothing. <br />
:arrow_right: JavaScript functions are first class objects with lexical scoping. <br />
:arrow_right: JavaScript has a very powerful object literal notation. Objects can be created simply by listing their components which was the inspiration for JSON (data interchange format). <br />
:arrow_right: **Functions**, **loose typing**, **dynamic objects**, **expressive object literal notation** are some of the good parts of JS (except a programming model based on global variables). <br />

## :hash: <a name="hoisting">Variable & Function Hoisting</a>:
In JavaScript, a **variable** or a **function** can be used before its been declared.
Consider the Following code example:

```
a = 10;
f();

function f() {
  console.log(a);         // prints value of a
}

var a;
```
Why code works this way in JavaScript? Its because of the term **_Hoisting_**. JavaScript has a default behavior of moving all declared variables and functions to the top of the current scope of the **current script** or **current function**. <br />
**Note**: Functions declared with `var` keyword (`var f = function() {}`) are not hoisted and JavaScript only hoists variable declaration not initialization. <br />
Consider the Following code example:

```
f();                     //  logs error "f is not a function"
var f = function() {
  //function body
};

var a;
console.log(a);         // prints 'undefined' since variable initialization isn't moved to the top of scope.
a = 10;
```
